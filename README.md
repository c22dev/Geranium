Tired of the "Other" category taking up all of your space on your iDevice, well, you found the solution ! Some users have cleaned more than 16Gb of storage with this tool !
Please note that those screenshots aren't accurate because they were took on a simulator that didn't have the cleaned directories. Calculated sizes aren't always accurate.
